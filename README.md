# binance-assignment

Notes:
- When adding a new list info item, Message ID and Creation Time are automatically generated and cannot be editted.
- To change permissions, please edit line 33 in /src/App.vue (in reality this would be fetched from an API)
- Records are persisted in local storage so users without target perms can view existing records.
- Website is mostly responsive on web, not mobile.
